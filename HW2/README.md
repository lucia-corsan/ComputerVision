# COMP425 - Homework 2
### Overview
- **Subject**: COMP425/COMP6341 Computer Vision, Winter 2024 (Universit√© Concordia).
- **Grade**: 30/30.

### Key Components
- **Hough Transform**: Leveraging the Hough transform to detect lanes accurately within a predefined region of interest (ROI) in an image.
- **RANSAC and Homography**: Employing RANSAC for reliable homography estimation (essential for tasks like augmented reality) where one image is overlaid onto another while maintaining correct perspective.

### Instructions to run the code
Navigate to the corresponding directory within the project folder in your terminal and execute the specific script for each part of the assignment. Each script will generate the corresponding figures, as you may see in the [report](https://github.com/lucia-corsan/ComputerVision/blob/1050c9ea9645226bd48e7eb9d8e79bfdfecc86ac/HW2/report.pdf).
