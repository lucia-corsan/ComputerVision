# COMP425 Implementations
### Overview
- **Subject**: COMP425/COMP6341 Computer Vision.
- **Session**: Winter 2024.
- **Institution**: Universit√© Concordia.

### Key Topics
- 2D Image Filtering.
- Edge and Corner Detection: corner response calculation, thresholding, and non-maximum suppression.
- Image Subsampling: Naive and anti-aliasing downsampling techniques.
- Hough Transform.
- Homography and RANSAC.
- Filter banks.
- K-Means Clustering for feature extraction.
- Bag-of-Words Representation.

### Repository Contents 
- `HW1`: Implementation of a **2D filtering**, **edge and corner detection** and **image sumsampling** functions for images.
- `HW2`:
  First, implementation of **Hough transform to find straight lanes in a road**.
  Secondly, creating a pipeline for estimating the homography, and **using the estimated homography in an AR (augmented reality) application**.
  
- `Visual Recognition System`: Implementation of a **simple texture recognition system** using the bag-of-words (BoW) approach.
