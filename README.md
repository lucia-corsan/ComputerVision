# COMP425 - Homework 1
### Overview
- **Subject**: COMP425/COMP6341 Computer Vision, Winter 2024 (Universit√© Concordia).
- **Grade**: 21/22.

### Key Components
- **2D Image Filtering**: Implementation of the `filter2d` function for 2D image filtering.
- **Edge Detection**: Calculation of gradient images in x and y directions and gradient magnitude using derivative filters.
- **Corner Detection**: Implementation of the Harris corner detector, including corner response calculation, thresholding, and non-maximum suppression.
- **Image Subsampling**: Implementation of naive and anti-aliasing downsampling techniques.

### Instructions to run the code
To run the individual components of the homework, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Make sure the images `iguana.png`, `building.jpg`, and `paint.png` are placed in the correct directory as specified in the homework instructions.

- For image filtering: 
  ```bash
  python utils.py

- For edge detection: 
  ```bash
  python edge.py

- For corner detection: 
  ```bash
  python corner.py

- For image subsampling: 
  ```bash
  python downsample.py
